1. We assumed that the modulus can only be positive and negative. However, since the elements should have a value between 0 and n-1 we opted to use the absolute value of the modulus to do the verifications and the random matrix creation.
2. The use of floorMod is justified because we need to always have a positive result, and in the case of the subtraction between 2 values we could have a negative result before the modulo operation. So we took the example from the documentation to force a positive modulus. The addition and subtraction should not pose any problem unless the modulus is negative. Check https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#floorMod-int-int- for the examples.
3. Comment on the report that the constructors on Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication are private to avoid creating instances of these objects. These are only temporarily created on the respective static methods
